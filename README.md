# Restaurant Management System - README

## Overview
The **Restaurant Management System** is a console-based application designed to streamline the operations of a restaurant. The program allows users to manage reservations, food orders, table assignments, bill payments, and closing operations in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

## Features
1. **Make Reservations**  
   Users can input customer details, reservation time, and party size. The system ensures table capacity is not exceeded.
   
2. **Check-in Reservations**  
   Allows customers to check in, and the system assigns a suitable table based on the reservation details.

3. **Enter Orders**  
   Accepts food orders for tables, with validation for maximum items per order and availability.

4. **Complete Orders**  
   Marks orders as completed once the food has been served.

5. **Calculate and Pay Bills**  
   Automatically calculates the bill with tax and tip. Bills can be paid to free up the table.

6. **Close the Restaurant**  
   Ensures all reservations are fulfilled, and no outstanding orders or unpaid bills exist before closing.
